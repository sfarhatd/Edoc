        <h2>Function of the lungs</h2>
          <div class="">
            <h3>WHAT do the lungs do?</h3>
            <p>They are responsible for breathing and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h3>Where are the lungs?</h3>
            <p>You have two lungs which are found inside your chest and are protected by the ribs on both sides.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h3>How do your lungs work?</h3>
            <p>Lungs play a very important role in our body.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>They help deliver oxygen to our vital organs so we can function normally.</li>
                <li>At the same time they also exchange carbon dioxide which is a waste product formed as part of organ and tissue activity.</li>
                <li>When we breathe in or inhale, our lungs expand outwards and downwards in our ribcage.</li>
                <li>When we breathe out or exhale, our lungs recoil and move upwards in our ribcage and the diaphragm relaxes. </li>
              </ul>

            <h2>What happens when your lungs become unwell</h2>
            <p>When you have an infection, the lungs can become inflamed and irritated </p>
            This can make you feel unwell with a cough, runny nose and a fever. Sometimes you might feel so unwell you don't feel like eating or drinking</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
          <div>
            <h3>Cough</h3>
              <p>A cough can be wet or dry.
                With a dry cough, you may have a sore throat and runny nose too.
                With a wet cough, you may bring up some yellow or green phlegm or mucus.
                Sometimes when you cough so much you may have some pains in your chest. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
              <h3>Wheeze</h3>
              <p>Wheeze is described as musical sounds your lungs make and is often found in people who have asthma.</p>
              <h3>Asthma</h3>
          <div>
                <p>Asthma is a condition where your breathing pipes that are found inside the lung, become inflammed.
                For some people with asthma, this happens when they exercise or if they get an infection.
                For others it can be if they have any contact with dust or pollen and for others it can just be random.</p>

        <h2>Medical tests and tools</h2>
        <p>Sometimes doctors use some special tests and tools to help them investigate why you might feel ill.
        They don't hurt and even though they look a little scary sometimes, they're very useful</p>
          <h3>Stethoscope</h4>
          <p>A STE-THE-SCOPE is a medical tool that has 2 ear pieces (like the ones you use to listen to music) and a round metal part at the bottom.
            The flat side of the round metal part is called the DIAPHRAGM (pronounced DI-A-FRAM) and the part on top is called the bell
            This is a really cool device that can let your doctor or nurse listen to the sounds your lung makes.</p>
          <h3>X-RAY</h3>
          <p>An X-Ray is a very special type of photograph that can allow doctors and nurses to see the inside of your chest including your lungs, bones and heart!
            It isn't painful and takes as long as taking a normal photograph with a camera. <p>
          <h3>Peak flow meter</h3>
          <p> A peak flow meter is a medical device that is shaped like a hollow tube with a dial and some numbers on the side.
          It is used in patients who have breathing problems such as asthma and we use it to measure how good your lungs are at breathing out air.
          If you want to be a star patient these are our top tips and instructions to use it so you can impress your doctor, nurse and family:
            <ol>
              <li> Make sure you place the dial down at 0 (no cheating).</li>
              <li> Place a new mouth piece onto the end (you don't want to blow into a dirty device do you?)</li>
              <li> Make sure you are standing up, with your back straight.</li>
              <li> Hold the device with any hand or maybe your parents might hold the peak flow meter for you. Make sure you don't place your fingers on top of the dial or numbers.</li>
              <li> Place your mouth around the mouth piece creating a tight seal as you don't want any air to escape.</li>
              <li> Take a deep breath and blow out as fast and hard as you can. Keep your back and head straight at all times.</li>
              <li> Have a look at the dial and repeat another 2 times! </li>
