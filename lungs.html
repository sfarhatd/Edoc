    <h2>Function of the lungs</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <h3>WHAT do the lungs do?</h3>
    <p>They are responsible for breathing and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3>Where are the lungs?</h3>
      <p>You have two lungs which are found inside your chest and are protected by the ribs on both sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3>How do your lungs work?</h3>
      <p>Lungs play a very important role in our bodies.
        Firstly they help deliver oxygen to our vital organs so we can function normally.
        At the same time they also exchange carbon dioxide which is a waste product formed as part of organ and tissue activity.
        When we breathe in or inhale, our lungs expand outwards and downwards in our ribcage.
        There is a big muscle at the base of our lungs called the diaphragm which helps with this, and shifts downwards.
        When we breathe out or exhale, our lungs recoil and move upwards in our ribcage and the diaphragm relaxes. </p>
    </div>
          <div class="">
            <h2>What happens when your lungs become unwell</h2>
            <p>When you have an infection, the lungs can become inflamed and irritated </p>
            This can make you feel unwell with a cough, runny nose and a fever. Sometimes you might feel so unwell you don't feel like eating or drinking</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h3>Cough</h3>
              <p>A cough can be wet or dry.
                With a dry cough, you may have a sore throat and runny nose too.
                With a wet cough, you may bring up some yellow or green phlegm or mucus.
                Sometimes when you cough so much you may have some pains in your chest. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
              <h3>Wheeze</h3>
              <p>Wheeze is described as musical sounds your lungs make and is often found in people who have asthma.</p>
              <h4>Asthma</h4>
                <p>Asthma is a condition where your breathing pipes that are found inside the lung, become inflammed.
                For some people with asthma, this happens when they exercise or if they get an infection.
                For others it can be if they have any contact with dust and for others it can be random.</p>
