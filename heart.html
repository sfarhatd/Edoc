    <h1>What does the heart do?</h1>
    <p>Your heart is a big pump.
      It works by pumping the blood to the lungs so it can be filled with oxygen and then back around the body to your muscles and organs</p>
    <h2>What does your heart look like? </h2>
    <p>Your heart is about the same size as a closed fist. </p>
    <h3>How many times does your heart normally beat per minute?</h3>
    <p>It depends how old you are but if you are between 5 and 12 it is usually 80-120 beats per minute!!<p>
    <h4>How many times will your heart beat in your lifetime</h4>
    <p>Can be over 3 BILLION times if you live until you are 80!</p>
    <h5>What sounds does my heart make?</h5>

    <h6>What happens if I have hole in my heart?</h6>
    <p>When we are all babies we are born with a little hole between two of our chambers. Normally this should close within a couple of days however in some children it stays open. Some children may also be born with a hole in a different part of the heart.
      When a doctor or nurse listens to your chest with a stethescope they may be able to hear a murmur, which is just a fancy way of saying an additional sound to the normal LUB DUB that our heart makes when it beats</p>
