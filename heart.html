        <h2>Function of the heart</h2>
        </div>

            <h3> What does the heart do?</h3>
            <p> Your heart is a big pump.
              It works by pumping the blood to the lungs so it can be filled with oxygen and then back around the body to your muscles and organs.
              For example, when you have to sprint in PE class, the muscles in your legs and arms need lots of oxygen to keep them strong and fast.
              In response, your heart beats faster to pump oxygen filled blood from the lungs to your muscles.
              At the same time, your muscles produce salts and waste that spill into the blood. That blood then has to circle back to the heart and so the cycle continues.</p>
            <h3> What does your heart look like? </h3>
            <p> Your heart is about the same size as a closed fist. </p>
            <h3> How many times does your heart normally beat per minute?</h3>
            <p> It depends how old you are but if you are between 5 and 12 it is usually 80-120 beats per minute!!<p>
            <h3> How many times will your heart beat in your lifetime</h3>
            <p> Can be over 3 BILLION times if you live until you are 80!</p>
            <h3> What sounds does my heart make?</h3>
            <p> It makes two sounds which sound like LUB DUB. Press below to hear </p>

      <h2>What happens when your heart gets sick?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3> What happens if I have hole in my heart?</h3>
          <p> When we are all babies we are born with a little hole between two of our chambers. Normally this should close within a couple of days however in some children it stays open. Some children may also be born with a hole in a different part of the heart.
          When a doctor or nurse listens to your chest with a stethescope they may be able to hear a murmur, which is just a fancy way of saying an additional sound to the normal LUB DUB that our heart makes when it beats.
          Some children with holes in their heart don't feel any different. Some can feel a bit breathless or have swelling in their body.
          A very small number of children need to have oxygen all the time because of the hole and will require some medicines or treatment.</p>
        <h3> What is valvular disease </h3>
          <p> In our heart we have 4 valves between the chambers and blood tubes that connect the heart.
          Valves are like little windows that open and close allowing blood to flow to the chamber or through blood vessels.
          Normally these open and close at different points in the heart cycle to allow steady flow.
          Sometimes children are born with problems in these valves such as being too floppy or too stiff.
          Normally doctors can give you some medications to help the heart but some children will need surgery to repair them.</p>
