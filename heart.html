    <h1>What does the heart do?</h1>
    <p>Your heart is a big pump.
      It works by pumping the blood to the lungs so it can be filled with oxygen and then back around the body to your muscles and organs</p>
    <h2>What does your heart look like? </h2>
    <p>Your heart is about the same size as a closed fist</p>
